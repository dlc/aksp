aksp - Amazon Keyword Search Poller

Generates RSS feeds of new items from Amazon that match a set of
keywords. Each time aksp is run for a particular set of keywords,
matches are stored in the internal database and a new feed is
generated.

Usage:

    $ aksp OPTIONS KEYWORDS

Options:

    -t TOKEN                Amazon token.
    -T /path/to/file        Path to file containing the amazon token.
    -s SECRET_ACCESS_KEY    Amazon secret access token.
    -S /path/to/file        Path to file containing the secret access token.
    -D /path/to/db/file     Where to store the database.
    -m MODE                 Amazon search mode.
    -l LOCALE               Use the specified locale.  See the XML::Amazon
                            docs for details.
    -O /path/to/feed/file   If specified, generate an RSS feed and write it
                            to this path.  Otherwise, just update the DB.

Both -t or -T and -s or -S are required.  

KEYWORDS is what to search for, and is required.

If -O is not specified, the database is updated but no output is
generated.  This is the recommended way to run aksp the first
time.
